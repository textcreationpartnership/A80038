            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>I Cannot but in all humble reverence, by theſe, as much as they can, manifeſt that affection which my ſtammering tongue knows not how to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, nor my unable pen to delineate. Oh that my heart were tranſparent! there would you ſee a Seat ordained for your vertuous and ſweeteſt ſelf; a Palace of Love, where affection daily waits, to do
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:111539:82"/>you ſervice; a Caſtle altogether impregnable, till 'twas over-pow'red by darts of love, ſhot from your eyes, by the ſtring of vertue. How then to expreſs a gratitude ſufficient to anſwer your good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is a thing altogether impoſſible, your vertue being as unlimitable as my affection: but ſuch as I can, I willingly offer; my ſelf, my love, yea my whole fortunes, I humbly preſent you withal. You have taken me out of my ſelf; and my thoughts are not ſo often in mine own breſt, as where you are. You are the Loadſtar of my thoughts, and the life of my deſires, with whom alone I deſire to paſs my life. No marvel, if all love, if all deſire, if all affect you: for worth and deſert cannot lie unregarded. I reſigne my ſelf as your priſoner, and as a Trophee of your victories, to remain</p>

               <p>I Doubt not (nay, I am confident) that you will wonder, that after the ungrate ſilence of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny by-paſt yeers, I ſhould now begin to make an apologie: but, I hope, my negligence acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, will obtain a parden. Deſiring therefore that you will think of me with favour, and impute my fault, not to a willing ingratitude, but to a too great diſtance. But why ſpeak I of diſtance? it was not that could make me hold back my due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects; but an incertainty, nay, I may truely ſay, an impoſſibility to ſend, was my chief, nay my one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reaſon: yet I hope a good occaſion will now ere long bring us together, and afford us that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of renewing friendſhip, which I have

To conclude, I ſhall think my ſelf obliged to you, if you give me that which I requeſt; and ſhall greatly wonder, if you give it me not. Farewel.</p>
